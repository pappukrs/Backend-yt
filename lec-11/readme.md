## Promises
--Promises in JavaScript have three states:

## Pending: During operations such as reading, writing, or appending, the        promise is in the pending state, and its value is undefined.

## Fulfilled: When the operation is successfully completed, the promise transitions to the fulfilled state.

## Rejected: If an error occurs during the operation, the promise transitions to the rejected state.
